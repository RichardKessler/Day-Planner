```

## Getting Started

You can access this application by going to: https://richardkessler.github.io/Day-Planner/

## Day-Planner Details

Once you acces the day planner you are presented with a clock at the top of the page.  This clock updates every second so you get an accurate reading of the current time.  Next you will see blocks of time starting fomr 6am and ending at 10pm.  For each hour there is a text input area for you to enter your appointments/events.  The end of the block has a save button that once pressed will save that hours block for whatever you have entered.  The information is saved and stays until you delete it and save again.  You may add extra appointments/events as needed.
